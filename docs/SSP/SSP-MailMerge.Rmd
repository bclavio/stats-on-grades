# Personalized Feedback for the Study Verification Test

This is an interpretive report of your responses to the study verification test. We hope this report will help you identify your current student profile, but also aid you in reflection and give resources to help you in your study life. 

The boxplots[^1] below show how you compare to a larger sample of first semester Medialogy students from Aalborg and Copenhagen. Specifically, they indicate the average self-ratings of all students in seven topics: social support for studying, high school habits, study habits at AAU, grit (i.e. perseverance when facing challenges and passion for long-term goals), growth mindset (i.e. believing that anyone can become smarter or more talented through effort and learning), time commitments (study and other), and understanding of Medialogy (see Figure 1) and the self-reported study hours per week (see Figure 2). Your self-reported values for each topic are indicated with red dots. The percentile ranks indicate the percentage of students whose scores are equal to or less than yours. A percentile rank lower than 50 means that you rated yourself lower than half the students. Low percentile ranks are not something to worry about or blame yourself for, as it is a starting point for your development and potential growth.

As the report is based on the questionnaire information alone, it may give only a rough indication of your true attitudes. Based on your self-reported answers we have created specific recommendations with concrete examples and links for you to get more comfortable in the Medialogy study environment (see the following pages). As a follow-up to this report, we will conduct a workshop to help you understand this report, (re)define your study goals, and talk about the students services you may desire.

[^1]: A *boxplot* illustrates the full range of variation (from min to max), the likely range of variation called the interquartile range (IQR) and a typical value (median). The three lines inside the curved box denotes the IQR, corresponding to the middle scores of the dataset - ranging from the 25th to the 75th percentile, in which the middle line marks the median.

## Specific Recommondations - what can you do
In this section you will receive a more detailed explanation of your results. The purpose of this information is to help you develop your skills and get the most from your university experience. Take a balanced approach to reviewing and utilizing this information. Do not assume that each statement is perfectly accurate just because it is printed in a formal manner; some statements may not fit you well. However, do not dismiss a statement just because it points to a challenge either.

Keep an open mind as you consider each statement. When it seems accurate, give serious thought to the suggestions. If the statement is puzzling, discuss it with someone who can help you interpret it. Approaching the feedback below in this way can be very helpful.

#### Social Support for Studying
Studying is a long-term endeavour and there will be times of frustration and doubt. During your education it can help to have a social network that understands that times of frustration can be part of pursuing a higher education degree. Your self-reported social support for studying placed you in the `r studentTable1[1,1]` percentile, and your responses suggest that you 
`r selectRecommondations[1,1]` 

#### High School Habits
In high school, the teacher often has the responsibility of giving homework, communicating learning material, recording attendance in class, ensure student progress, and help the students when required.

Adopting good or improving your study habits will help you and your learning progress. Think about the various opportunities in terms of jobs a degree in Medialogy provides. You can use this in order to fuel your habit change, direct your ambition, as well as your sense of personal responsibility for your future.

#### Time Commitments (study and other)
Studying requires a lot of time and dedication in order to succeed. Being intelligent and having talent can help but does not replace the need for dedicating time and effort to studying. The ECTS system assumes that you spend 45 hours a week during your education, and this means that your work in courses and projects are evaluated and graded based on what a student can do within the nominated hours.
You reported planning to use "`r studyingHoursNA`" hours weekly for studying, which indicates that you

Meeting study demands is difficult over long-term with too many other obligations.
During your eduation, you should carefully review your commitments and other activities that you need or want to dedicate time to vis-&agrave;-vis the study demands. Should you not able to dedicate around 45 hours to study each week, you should carefully plan these hours and perhaps even minutes, so you do not overwork in wrong places. As students progress they get better at adjusting their study hours and become more aware of how much time they should dedicate to the different study activities. It is quite natural for students to underestimate the workload requirement in the first year. The adjustment is a process, and you just started your transistion to university life. This takes time, for some shorter for others longer.

#### Understanding of Medialogy
Choosing a suitable education can be difficult, and students should reflect on their choice of education, especially, in the first semester(s). Your understanding about what you will learn in the Medialogy programme is in the `r studentTable1[7,1]` percentile, meaning that
`r selectRecommondations[7,1]` 
Students learn only little about: manual content creation, work with aesthetics, professional moving making, working as a rigging artist, and using adobe software, but learn more about applying math knowledge and programming skills. Previous students with different expectations either started appreciating the content, skills, and opportunities of a Medialogy degree or changed to other programmes or educations. Attending the Med Awards event (usually in November) and seeing other student projects can inspire you and show what you will be able to do if you apply yourself to what Medialogy can offer. Contacting older students in the Medialogy facebook group, study counselors, and going to the study cafe can also provide you information about the education and what it means to be a Medialogy student. You can find information about Medialogy and student testimonials [here](tinyurl.com/AAUaboutMedialogy) (tinyurl.com/AAUaboutMedialogy).


## Student counselor services
If you need help for specific challenges as a student, we recommend you to contact a student counselor. Unlike counselors at high schools, student counselors at AAU are students studying themselves. They know many of the challenges that a Medialogy student faces, having experienced it themselves or helped fellow students. The student counselor is a good resource for handling student challenges such as:

- Exam/presentation anxiety

- Failing courses (e.g. programming or math) 

- Time management

- Guidance in your choice of study
