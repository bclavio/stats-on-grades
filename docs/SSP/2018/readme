History:
SSP v.1: short questionnaire, answered by AAL and CPH students.
SSP v.2: longer questionnaire, answered by AAL students only, while CHP students answered the SSP v.1 (by mistake).

Files: 
- SSP-MailMerge.Rmd: the Rmarkdown file which works for the SSP v.1 and a subset from the SSP v.2. 
- SSP-MailMergeCPHR.R: R file created for the SSP v.1 * 
- SSP-MailMerge.R: R file created for the SSP v.2. *

* Both R files include: data cleaning, data analysis, automatically runs the Rmarksdown file, and send email to student (should be commented out).

OBS! Before running the whole scripts, make sure to commment out the part that sends emails to students.
