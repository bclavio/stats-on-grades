# Study Verification Test - Student Report

This is an interpretive report of your responses to the study verification test. Its purpose is to help you identify your student profile within specific topics.
>>>>>>> 040f1ba3ad9d20c3e94a0c8a3fe78a4b02ad646b

The boxplots[^1]  show how you compare to a larger sample of first semester Medialogy students from Aalborg and Copenhagen. Specifically, they indicate the average self-ratings of all students in seven different topics (see Figure 1) and the self-reported study hours per week (see Figure 2). Your self-reported value for each topic is indicated with red dots. A value less than 0.5 means that you rated yourself lower than the average student. The percentiles indicate the percentage of students whose scores are equal to or less than yours. Based on these results we have created specific recommendations for you to get more comfortable in the Medialogy study environment. 


As the report is based on the questionnaire information alone, it may give only a rough indication of your true attitudes. Your advisor or student counselor will help you understand your scores and find the services you desire.

[^1]: A *boxplot* can give you information regarding the range, distribution, and centre of a statistical data set. The rectangular box denotes the middle 50% of scores, in which the line dividing the box into two parts marks the mid-point of the data (i.e. median). The upper and lower lines (also called whiskers) represent the 25% highest scores (upper line) and the 25% lowest scores (lower line). Outliers are defined as data points outside the whiskers and plotted as black dots.

## Specific Recommondations
In this section you will receive a more detailed explanation of your results. The purpose of this information is to help you develop your skills and get the most from your university experience. Take a balanced approach to reviewing and utilizing this information. Do not assume that each statement is perfectly accurate just because it is printed in a formal manner; some statements may not fit you well. However, do not dismiss a statement just because it points to a challenge.
<<<<<<< HEAD
Keep an open mind as you consider each statement. When it seems accurate, give serious thought to any suggestions that accompany the statement. If the statement is puzzling, discuss it with someone who can help you interpret it. Approaching the information in this way can be very helpful.

#### Social Support for Studying
Studying is a long-term endeavour and there will be times of frustration and doubt. Your self-reported social support for studying placed you in the `r studentTable1[1,2]` percentile, and your responses suggest that you 
`r selectRecommondations[1,1]` 

#### High School Habits
In high school, the teacher often has the responsibility of giving homework, communicating learning material, recording attendance in class, ensure student progress, and help the students when required. Your self-reported high school habits placed you in the `r studentTable1[2,2]` percentile, which suggests that you 
`r selectRecommondations[2,1]` 

#### Study Habits
Weak study habits are the single greatest cause of academic problems at university. Your self-reported study habits placed you in the `r studentTable1[3,2]` percentile,
`r selectRecommondations[3,1]` 

#### Grit
Talent without hard work rarely amounts to anything ambitious. Making the effort to stay with a problem (or challenge) for long enough, increases your chances of cracking it and mastering new skills. This requires time and dedication, and is known as grit. Students with high self-reported values in grit, are less likely to drop out and fail exams than those with lower scores. Your self-reported grit places you in the `r studentTable1[4,2]` percentile,
`r selectRecommondations[4,1]` 

#### Growth mindset 
Seeing your intelligence as something that you can actively influence and grow is referred to as having a growth mindset. Students with high self-reported values in growth mindset are less likely to drop out and fail exams than those with lower scores. Your self-reported understanding of intelligence placed you in the `r studentTable1[5,2]` percentile, 
`r selectRecommondations[5,1]` 

#### Study and Work
Studying requires a lot of time and dedication in order to succeed. Being intelligent and having talent can help but does not replace the need for dedicating time and effort to studying. The ECTS system assumes that you spend 45 hours a week on your education. You reported using `r studyingHours` hours weekly for studying, which indicates that you are using
`r selectRecommondations[6,1]` 
amount of time for studying. Meeting these demands is difficult over long-term with too many other obligations.
`r selectRecommondations[2,2]`

#### Understanding of Medialogy
Choosing a suitable education can be difficult, and students should reflect on their choice of education, especially, in the first semester(s). Your understanding about what you will learn in the Medialogy programme is in the `r studentTable1[7,2]` percentile, meaning that
`r selectRecommondations[7,1]` 
Previous students with different expectations either learned to appreciate the content, skills, and opportunities of a Medialogy degree or changed to other programmes or educations. Attending the Med Awards event (usually in November) and seeing other student projects can give you an idea of what you will be able to do if you apply yourself to what Medialogy can offer. Contacting older students in the Medialogy facebook group, study counselors, and going to the study cafe can also provide you information about the education and what it means to be a Medialogy student. You can find information about Medialogy and student testimonials [here](tinyurl.com/AAUaboutMedialogy) (tinyurl.com/AAUaboutMedialogy).
